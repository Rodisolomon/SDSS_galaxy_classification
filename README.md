# SDSS_galaxy_classification
This is a my final project of ASTR21100, the goal is to classify galaxy clusters based on morphology using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). 
My instructor is @Andrey Kravtsov, TAs are @Yue Pan and @Aster Taylor. 
Image data comes from https://www.kaggle.com/c/galaxy-zoo-the-galaxy-challenge/data. I used only images_test_rev1 folder for easier testing.
